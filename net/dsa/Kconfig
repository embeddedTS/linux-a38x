	---help---
	  Enable creation of debugfs files for the DSA core.

	  These debugfs files provide per-switch information, such as the tag
	  protocol in use and ports connectivity. They also allow querying the
	  hardware directly through the switch operations for debugging instead
	  of going through the bridge, switchdev and DSA layers.

	  This is also a way to inspect the stats and FDB, MDB or VLAN entries
	  of CPU and DSA links, since they are not exposed to userspace.
